# Policies

Policies is a WIP implementation of ReABAC. An authorization scheme I developed to help organizations slow-roll away
from traditional RBAC and ABAC authentication models to ReBAC. The ReBAC implementation is provided by Auth0's OpenFGA.

## Requirements

* etcd
* OpenFGA (or probably regular FGA when it releases as well)

Configuration instructions for running in a non-local environment TBD.
